SUMMARY :

The refactored code will work efficiently on huge sets of data with not having to loop through the data multiple times. There will be a signigicant reduction in run time when the code loops through the data set once versus multiple iterations. With a data set of about 3000 records and just 11 stock types, the run time improved by half a second when the refactored code was executed.
